                    Narendra Damodardas Modi (born 17 September 1950) is an
                    Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime
                    minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of

                    from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party
                    (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a
                    right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer
                    organisation. <br />
                    Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the
                    party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament,
                    the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since
                    1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign
                    direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending
                    on healthcare and social welfare programmes. He began a
                    high-profile sanitation campaign, initiated a controversial
                    demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and weakened
                    or abolished environmental and labour laws.{" "}

                    Shah was the BJP's in-charge for India's largest and
                    politically most crucial state, Uttar Pradesh, during the
                    2014 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP and its NDA won 73 out of
                    80 seats. As a result, Shah rose to national prominence and
                    was appointed as the party's national president in July
                    2014.
